# Weather Update

Before, our weather rating only included 2 variables: annual precipitations, and a bonus given from the location of the city, it is located near the mountains or the sea. We have updated this rating to make it more **reliable**.

We have indeed kept the two pre-existing variables, and we have added a new one: the average temperature. Now, when precipitations are similar, warmer cities rank higher... Which makes a lot of sense!

We have also seized this opportunity to update the rent data, and made a few adjustements to the Transports rating, in order to make it fairer. The old Transport rating was to complacent to isolated cities which still had an airport. Now, this issue is solved!

The consequences of this update have been massive - the biggest move since the inception of our rating. The new top 10 cities are now:

1. Lyon
2. Bordeau
3. Nantes
4. Clermont-Ferrand
5. Tours
6. La Rochelle
7. Narbonne
8. Nancy
9. Avignon
10. Le Mans

Work well, work remote!
