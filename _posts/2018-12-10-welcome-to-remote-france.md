# Welcome to Remote France ! 

Remote France is the best tool to choose the ideal french city for you to work & live.

We provide a comprehensive list of the best french cities according to objective criteria. In a spirit of openness, we give you access to our methodology. There's no secret : the cities in our ranking are objectively and empirically the best, and all deserve precisely their place in the ranking!

France has always been a very centralized country. Paris is indeed the heart of the country, this cannot be denied. However, the Capital city is not necessarly the perfect place for everyone. Rents are very expensive, the weather is not great. And, if you don't like big cities, it is fair to say that it is a Hell!

We offer alternatives which highlight the strenghts of the whole french territory, without omitting any location. We do not apply any bonus to any city or region. We remain strictly objective. But it so happens that our ranking brings up cities from a lot of french regions : from Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes (Lyon) to Bretagne (Rennes), Grand Est (Nancy), Nouvelle Aquitaine (Bordeau), or Occitanie (Narbonne) and Centre-Val de Loire (Tours).

This ranking is an opportunity for all of us to discover in depth the treasures of the various french regions!
